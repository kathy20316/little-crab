        Little Crab
        ===========

This is a homework which is based on the book "Introduction to Programming with Greenfoot" by Michael KÃ¶lling.

In the scenario, I practice changing background and Actors, adding more sub-classes of the Actor superclass 
such as Starfish (GIMP tool used to mofify the images), and adjusting the actions related.

I practice changing the act methods of the main character - little crab. The little crab is not moving forward 
automatically as in the original version, but it moves and turns when the users use navigation arrows on the keyboards.
By doing this, the users can manipulate actions of the little crab which makes the game more interactive and interesting.
