        Little Crab
        ===========

This is a homework which is based on the book "Introduction to Programming with Greenfoot" by Michael KÃ¶lling.

In the scenario, I practice changing background of the world, adding more classes and adjusting the actions related.
I also practice changing the act methods of the main character - little crab. 
By doing this, I can manipulate actions of the little crab which makes the game more interactive and interesting.
